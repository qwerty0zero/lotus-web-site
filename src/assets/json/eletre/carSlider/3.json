    "The forward-facing telephoto camera can see up to 500 metres in front of the Eletre. The additional wide-angle lens, 4 side cameras, and rear sensor provide full 360Â° coverage.",
    "Cutting-edge millimetre-wave radar calculates the position, speed, and direction of potential obstacles, also accounting for low-lying obstructions."]
